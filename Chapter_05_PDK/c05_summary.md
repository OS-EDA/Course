# Chapter 5 PDK Examination (Open IHP130)
## Description
This chapter marks the start of the deeper dive parts of the course. After succesfully generating a GDS it is a good moment to look into the underlying Process Design Kit. This is also a good waypoint to talk about what open-source means in the context of EDA. The lecture will start with how a design maps to standard cells. A basic exmaple design will be viewed and examined. A walk through the main parts of the open-source IHP PDK (ihp-sg13g2) follows. The training session is mostly about the tool KLayout and exploring the GDS (from training T4) in regards to the PDK.
