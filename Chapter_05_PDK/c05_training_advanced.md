## Add layers in the script

- You will see only a little of the standard cells layers.
- That is because the script is very basic.

##### Task: Enhance the 2.5d script

- Try to add at least one more layer to the 2.5d script
- Run again and see the result.

##### Tip: Cheat from a pre-made script

Here is a script with some more layers in it:
