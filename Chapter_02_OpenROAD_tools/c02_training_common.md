### Getting the words in place

In the beginning it can be hard to learn all the new words and give them meaningful connections immediately.

Let's try to create a timeline (or taskline) for "How to make microchips?" in a joint effort.

##### Task: Create a diageram "How to make a microchip?" 

- Everyone can give a keyword of the topic "How to make a microchip?"
- We try to figure out the meaning and the position in a timeline / taskline?
- Flipchart, Whiteboard, Texteditor?
