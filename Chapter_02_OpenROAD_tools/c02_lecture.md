# Chapter 2 - OpenROAD workflow 

## History of OpenROAD

### Foundations and Realization of Open, Accessible Design (OpenROAD)

### Courses for OpenROAD

A single excellent project (some of us might know):

### Help is on the way

Kudos to this course:

### Help with the terminology

Searching the terms with a standard search engine might not bring usefull results every time.
Matt Venn created a page for EDA terminology:

### The list of open-source tools

The list of flow steps and flow components in ORFS contains the information about the original open-source tools.

We will dive a little deeper into this list with the course training:

### Meet the developers

There is a slack community with most of the open-source silicon projects and people in it:

[https://open-source-silicon.dev](https://open-source-silicon.dev)

This is the perfect place, if you 

- search for people you heard of in open-source EDA.
- want to reach out to tool developers.
- have all sorts of questions in open-source EDA.
- look for a specific problem and want to see if others already are in a discussion about it.
- want to share your experience and help others.

### 

Most of the tools in open-source EDA have their own channel in this slack. Just try search and add for the channel names.
