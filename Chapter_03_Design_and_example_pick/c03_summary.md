# Chapter 3 - Digital design and example pick

## Description
It is expected that the participants have a heterogeneous spectrum of backgrounds in digital microchip design. This chapter aims at creating a common ground to work with. Some basics about designing digital circuits will be covered in this chapter. 

#### Digital design
The topics to be covered are:
* What are the paradigms, the languages, the formats?
* Which of them can be used for open-source EDA?
* How to categorize and evaluate digital designs?
* The complexity of digital designs.
References for selfstudying digital design are listed. 

#### Set of ready-to-use design examples
The available set of design examples for the training sessions gets introduced. The features and complexity of each of the design examples will be examined and displayed in a training session.

#### choosing an example
The training of chapter 3 is the first session in which the participants will work on the computer workstations. A set of basic explanations and system tools gets introduced. This includes the following items:
* Login at the workstation
* Workenvironment (VSCode?)
* Console
* Filesystem and Workdata
* Designexmaples Exploration
