# Optional preparations for the course
Before the course starts, you can take some optional preparations regarding the software tools that will be used during the course. Either you can install them locally on your own computer or get access to a preconfigured server from IHP. 
1. The local installation might give a little more individualization and flexibility. 
2. The IHP server is surely the more convenient and carefree approach. 

## 1.Install the EDA tools on your own computer
### The docker container IIC-OSIC-TOOLS
With the following steps a preconfigured docker gets installed. The docker was created and maintained by:

Institute for Integrated Circuits (IIC) at the Johannes Kepler University Linz (JKU)

and is avaiable in their Github with more detailed installation instructions:

### Rough install steps for Linux (Ubuntu) with X-server:
1. Get the git repository ```git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/iic-jku/iic-osic-tools.git```
2. Manage Docker as a non-root user https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/
3. Follow the README of the IIC-OSIC-TOOLS:
https://github.com/iic-jku/IIC-OSIC-TOOLS/blob/main/README.md
4. Environment, Readme chapter 4.1 
https://github.com/iic-jku/IIC-OSIC-TOOLS/blob/main/README.md#41-customizing-environment
5. X-Server variant, Readme chapter 4.3 + 4.3.1 + 4.3.3 
https://github.com/iic-jku/IIC-OSIC-TOOLS/blob/main/README.md#43-using-a-local-x-server
6. Shell variables, Readme chapter 4.4.1
https://github.com/iic-jku/IIC-OSIC-TOOLS/blob/main/README.md#441-for-the-linuxmacos-bash-scripts
7. Start the docker

## 2. Use an IHP server for the EDA tools
### Ask at IHP for a login
### Getting started on the server
