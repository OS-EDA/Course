# Chapter 7 - OpenROAD flow scripts

## What are we going to do now?

### Previous chapters
What happend on the way to here:

- GDS-2-RTL: OpenROAD
- OpenROAD flow scripts (ORFS)
- ORFS flow steps and flow components
- First run of the flow scripts
- Analysing: Heatmaps and more (ORFS GUI)
- A Dive into the PDK

### This chapter
NOW:

Make your design better.

### Idea of today

There is a good tutorial about ORFS in the official documentation:

[https://openroad-flow-scripts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/FlowTutorial.html](https://openroad-flow-scripts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/FlowTutorial.html)

The ORFS online-tutorial was not written for the use with the IHP PDK especially, but we can adopt this easily.
