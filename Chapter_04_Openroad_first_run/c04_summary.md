# Chapter 4 - Openroad: First run
## Description
Equiped with the examples at hand and a first look into the computer enviroment (workstations), the next step is to get Openroad to build a GDS. The lectures of this chapter will introduce how to use Openroad. The configuration files for the set of examples will be discussed. This creates a first look-out onto the upcoming chapters and motivates deeper dive into the tools. But still, the focus of chapter 4 is on the training session.

#### Using Openroad
Openroad is a script and command driven toolchain. For participants that are used to graphical user interfaces (GUIs) this might be somehow unfamiliar. Therefore the lecture will help understanding how to start an Openroad run and what the expected output will look like. The lecture encourages the usage of a console and keyboard instead of a mouse, as it will be part of all upcoming trainings. The lecture is compact and centers around the ease of use. Topics:
* Find the examples in Openroad
* Basics of the configuration files
* What is an Openroad script?
* How to start an Openroad run
* What to expect as output from an Openroad run
* Examining a GDS with a viewer
#### Success point: My first GDS
This training session will create a correct GDS file of the choosen example. The generated data from the Openroad run will be examined on a basic level. Regarding to the overall top-to-down approach, this is still one of the top parts in the course. A successful and fast to reach result is the goal. All steps for the deeper dive in the upcoming chapters can be seen and motivated here.
