### Rename the textfile

You remember your textfile from earlier?

##### Task: Rename the textfile

- Do this in a shell terminal (not in GNOME, means: no mouse, no file explorer!)
- Navigate to your created dirctory (with ```cd``` and ```cd ..```)
- Rename you file to another filename with ```mv```
- If you don't know how to use ```mv```, read the man page first with ```man mv``` and learn the usage.

### Change the content in the textfile

##### Task: Change the content in the textfile

- Do this in a shell terminal (not in GNOME, means: no mouse, no file explorer!)
- Navigate to your created dirctory (with ```cd``` and ```cd ..```)
- Open the textfile with ```nano <your filename>```
- Examine the two lines at the bottom. These are keyboard commands for the nano editor. Find the key shortcuts for save and exit. What are they?
- Change some text, save and exit your textfile.
