#####
 
* That is why we have Cheat Sheets.
* They're made for cheating the hard parts.
* Cheatsheets work best when printed as handouts. 
* You should have them nearby the computer during the course.

### Questions
![](pics_lecture/questions.png)

* The questions are for re-visiting and remembering a previous chapter. 
* They guide an interactive session between the trainer and the room:
    * Trainer: Asks the questions.
    * Room: Answers the questions. 
        * Skipping a question is fine. 
        * Not knowing the answer is fine.
        * This is not a test nor a challenge.
        * Think of this as a helpfull recap of yesterdays content.
    * If no answer is found, the trainer helps with the answer.
