Questions:

* The questions are for re-visiting and remembering a previous chapter. 
* They guide an interactive session between the trainer and the room:
    * Trainer: Asks the questions.
    * Room: Answers the questions. 
        * Skipping a question is fine. 
        * Not knowing the answer is fine.
        * This is not a test nor a challenge.
        * Think of this as a helpfull recap of yesterdays content.
    * If no answer is found, the trainer helps with the answer.

## Feedback and Cheat Sheets

- We please you to give us feedback for the course.
- There is a short timeframe each day reserved for feedback.

We have two ideas about this:

1. Developing Cheatsheets together
2. Collecting general feedback

### Cheetsheats

::: columns

:::: {.column width=15%}

![](pics_lecture/cheatsheet.png)

:::: {.column width=70%}

Some things are really hard to remember:

* Abbreviations 
* Complex relations and graphics
* EDA tools workflow
* Schedule of the week
* Mathematics (joking, wer're not doing math here)
* ...

::::

:::

#####
 
* That is why we would like to develop Cheat Sheets.
* They're made for cheating the hard parts.
* Cheatsheets work best when printed as handouts. 
* One can have them nearby the computer while learning.

### Cheatsheet example

![Cheatsheet Chapter 1](pics_lecture/c01_cheatsheet.png)

### Cheatsheet example

![Cheatsheet Chapter 5](pics_lecture/c05_cheatsheet.png)

### Empty Cheatsheet printversion

![Cheatsheet Chapter 5](pics_lecture/c01_cheatsheet_empty.png)

### General feedback

Genral feedback:

- The general feedback will be collected verbaly in the room. 
- Everyone has the opportunity to give feedback
- We will write down the feedback, without your name.

### What will happen with your feedback?

- We will put the feedback into Github issues.
- Right now, think of Github issues as some sort of tracker- or ticketsystem.
- Your feedback will not be connected to you (Anonymous).
- You can join a public discussion in the Github issues, if you want to.

## The Training sessions

### Login at IHP
Now:

- Onboarding to the computers for everyone

### Levels
* Success points inbetween lectures
- This is too fast
- This is too slow

## Certificate

We will explain live about the certificate of the course.

## Open-source EDA for digital designs

### From Design to Microchip

### Further topics
* What is the new thing with this course?
* Advantages of open-source in EDA
* The actual state of open-source EDA
* Goals of this course.
* How to participate and interact with this course.
* Producing chips at IHP with the open PDK
