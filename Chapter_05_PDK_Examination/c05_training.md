## Open Klayout

* Viewer mode and edit mode

## Load the GDS from the example

* Search for the final GDS from your example run and load it into Klayout

## Use a LYP file

* Recall, what layer properties and the .lyp file are.
* Search the sg13g2 lyp-file from the PDK and enable it in Klayout.
* See the change in the layer list of Klayout.

## Navigate through the Layers and the GDS view

* Layer list:
    * Enable "View follows selsction
    * De-/Select multiple layers and see the change
* Zoom out to see the complete GDS and de-/select layers
* Zoom into details and de-/select layers
* Move the GDS file while zoomed in.

## Load the GDS from the cell library

* Now open another GDS: the standard cell library from the sg13g2 PDK.
* The standard cell library is a single GDS file. Search and load the library file.

## Pick one cell

* All the cell names are displayed in a window to the left. One cell is selected (displayed in bold). The GDS of this cell is viewed. Try to bring another cell "to the top" to see that cells GDS.
* Repeat the layer navigation like in the eaxmple GDS.

## Bonus: Matchmaking a cell

* Here is a 3D rendering of a standard cell (Insert name? Or find name?)
* ToDo: Insert cell picture
* Can you identify the layers and their order from the cell?

## Bonus (Advanced): Transistor count

* Load the gds of the standard cell XXXXX (t.b.d.)
* How many transistors are in the cell?
